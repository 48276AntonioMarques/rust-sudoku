# [Rust] Sudoku Solver

## Introduction
This project is another implementation of a sudoku solver, this time using rust.
The focus of the project is to aim for a more time and memory efficient algorithm.

## User Interface
The user interface in this project should match the following logic:
* Up until version 1.+ - TUI
* From version 2.+ - GUI with a support library

## Objective
Develop a sudoku application capable of solving and generating sudoku.

## Current Progress
* **[WIP] Implement logic and restrictions**
* Generate a solvable board
* Implement a solving algorithm
* Develop a UI
* Play capability
